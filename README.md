## My process

For this project i took a lot of help from kevin powells videos to get a better understanding of how to structure my HTML and CSS and got a better understanding of how to work for mobile first.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt to work for mobile first.
I used is in css for the first time.
I used grid more.
i learnt how to use variables locally.

### Continued development

Id like to get more into javascript and animations at a latter point.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell taCkling this challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2WL6KkqhLQ) - This helped me learn SO much about HTML structuring and how to write CSS cleaner.
